# Japanese Resources

> An opinonated collection of Japanese resources meant to compliment immersion, see [here](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/guide/) for an explanation. A lot of these resources come from [here](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/resources/) as well as the TMW discord server's `#resources-sharing` channel.

## Learning guides

This section is dedicated to Japanese learning guides. You should start here if you don't know much about learning Japanese, immersion or if you just want a refresher.

## Hiragana & Katakana

Hiragana and katakana (commonly called *kana* together) form two basic alphabets used in Japanese and are often the starting point in one's Japanese learning journey. You may or may not want to learn how to write them, but at the very least you will need to be able to recognize and read them.
