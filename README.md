# Japanese Resources

> An opinonated collection of Japanese resources meant to compliment immersion, see [here](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/guide/) for an explanation. A lot of these resources come from [here](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/resources/) as well as the TMW discord server's `#resources-sharing` channel.

## Learning guides

This section is dedicated to Japanese learning guides. Start here unless you know what you're doing.

## Kanji

If you intend to do isolated kanji study, you can use the following resources. **It is strongly suggested to skip straight to vocabulary** and to come back here if really needed, with maybe the exception of learning phonetics.

- Kanji mnemonics
  - [RRTK450](https://mega.nz/file/2SJiWC4b#hL98qtC_hiLlQDg0LqVJoqD2-5ywT2Nwd4kjROY_KwQ) - A shortened "recognition" version of [RTK](https://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-Complete-Japanese-Characters/dp/0824835921). **Disclaimer: The stories were taken from a website and some of there are pretty offensive.**

## Vocabulary

Vocabulary refers to words, not kanji directly. Words are usually made up of kanji and one shouldn't confuse the two. As it is recommended to do a mining deck after learning basic vocabulary, there's only a single recommended resource.

- **[Kaishi 1.5k](https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi/)** - The recommended beginner vocabulary Anki deck. Latest release found [here](https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi/releases) and [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1196762551).
