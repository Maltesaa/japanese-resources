# Japanese Resources

> An opinonated collection of Japanese resources meant to compliment immersion, see [here](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/guide/) for an explanation. A lot of these resources come from [here](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/resources/) as well as the TMW discord server's `#resources-sharing` channel.

## Learning guides

This section is dedicated to Japanese learning guides. You should start here if you don't know much about learning Japanese, immersion or if you just want a refresher.

- [Immersion-Based Japanese Learning](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/guide/) - Frequently updated guide introducing everything you need to learn Japanese. Written by [yours truly](https://github.com/donkuri/).
- [TMW's guide to learning Japanese](https://learnjapanese.moe/guide/) - Fantastic guide that has helped thousands learn Japanese using immersion. Written by shoui.
- [Animecards' learning Japanese guide](https://animecards.site/learningjapanese/) - A slightly more concise guide dedicated to learning Japanese through immersion. Written by QM.

## Hiragana & Katakana

Hiragana and katakana (commonly called *kana* together) form two basic alphabets used in Japanese and are often the starting point in one's Japanese learning journey. You may or may not want to learn how to write them, but at the very least you will need to be able to recognize and read them.

- Memorizing the kana
  - [Ved's kana learning game](https://vedxyz.github.io/kana/) - The most complete kana learning game. Do this for a few days to learn kana.
  - [DJT Kana](https://djtguide.neocities.org/kana/) - Same as above but slightly simpler. Made by the folks at DJT.
  - [Taipo](https://euclidean-whale.itch.io/taipo) - 2D tower defense game that has you input kana.
  - [Tofugu's hiragana guide](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/) - Another approach to learning hiragana with mnemonics.
 
- Writing the kana
  - [Takumi's hiragana writing guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD3FJgij79c) - Learn how to write hiragana (if you want to).
  - [Takumi's katakana writing guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf-n_qI2occ) - The same but for katakana.

## Kanji

If you intend to do isolated kanji study, you can use the following resources. It is strongly suggested to skip straight to vocabulary and to come back here if really needed, with maybe the exception of learning phonetics.

- Kanji mnemonics
  - [RRTK450](https://mega.nz/file/2SJiWC4b#hL98qtC_hiLlQDg0LqVJoqD2-5ywT2Nwd4kjROY_KwQ) - A shortened "recognition" version of [RTK](https://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-Complete-Japanese-Characters/dp/0824835921). **Disclaimer: The stories were taken from a website and some of there are pretty offensive.**
  - [Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course] - An arguably better version of Remembering the Kanji. Has [an accompanying Anki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1564742924)
  - [The Kanji Map](https://thekanjimap.com/) - A website meant to help you better visualize kanji components. Doesn't always link kanji in the most logical (or correct) manner, but can be a start.
 
- Kanji phonetics
  - [Usagichan Kanji Phonetics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xyynMQiOuqlC_cBBTwG9t3snRubHqU7e/view?usp=drive_link) - An Anki deck meant to help you learn phonetic radicals.
  - [Kanji Code](https://thekanjicode.com/) - A kanji phonetics book based on the PhD dissertation of the author. There is a [companion Anki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/470563167).
