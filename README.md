## Hiragana & Katakana

Hiragana and katakana (commonly called *kana* together) form two basic alphabets used in Japanese and are often the starting point in one's Japanese learning journey. You may or may not want to learn how to write them, but at the very least you will need to be able to recognize and read them.
